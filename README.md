:wave: Hello there! Welcome to my Github repository!

:school: I'm pursuing my Bachelor of Technology (2021 passout) in Computer Science and Engineering at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai, India. I am interested in research works in the field of **Artificial Intelligence, Networks and Data Science**. My recent publication aims to improve the performance of **parallel genetic algorithms** by introducing a migration strategy that enables the algorithm to explore the search space without entering into premature convergence. Apart from this, I have conducted an elaborate **survey on different migration operators** proposed for specific optimization problems that is currently under review process.

:pushpin: During my B.Tech program, I worked in a research group called SRM CARE (Center for Applied Research and Education) as an **undergrad researcher** where I was part of a team that built [eSkill](https://care.srmist.edu.in/eskill/) - an online self evaluation tool built to prepare students for competitive examinations and interviews. The application is currently deployed and is being used by 3000+ students and faculties across all campuses of SRM IST.

:pushpin: I've interned with [AT&T](https://www.linkedin.com/company/att/) as a part of their AT&T Aspire program over a period of 3 months to work in the field of Natural Language Processing. I worked on a **Spam Classification model** that detects spam messages as the message reaches the inbox. Last summer, I interned at Crio.Do - An EduTech startup that provides hands-on experience on real-world tech-projects. I worked as a [Java Back End Developer](https://criodo.github.io/Crio-Launch-Feb-2020-abhishekchandar23/) working on QMoney - A stockmarket portfolio and QBox -  a secure File transfer protocol application. I worked on multiple APIs to fetch real-time stockmarket data and implemented **Factory design pattern** to abstract the APIs from client side. I also worked with Jackson and Data structures to handle the API by creating custom POJOs for converting the fetched data into a structured format.

:pushpin: Having a keen interest in Machine Learning and Data Science, I have worked on projects that could potentially create a positive impact in the society. One of them is called **Anonymous Accident Reporting System (AARS)** which is a Flutter application built to encourage people to report an encountered accident. It is based on **TFLite Deep learning model** for Image classification that is trained to detect an accident scene. This application can be used to effectively report accidents to catalyze the process of taking the victim to the nearest hospital. 

:pushpin: I enjoy travelling and attending hackathons. Among the many hackathons that we've won as a team, one of my memorable experience was winning the **first place** at the Infineon Campus Hackathon 2019. The task was to identify a time and space efficient data format to store and query large datasets. Understanding the hierarchial nature of the data provided to us, we implemented the Parquet data format that proved to the most efficient data format for the given dataset. 

Some of my undergrad electives include Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Analytics.
